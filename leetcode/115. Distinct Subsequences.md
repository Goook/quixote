Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

rabbbit
^^^^ ^^
rabbbit
^^ ^^^^
rabbbit
^^^ ^^^
```
**Example 2:**

```
Input: S = "babgbag", T = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:

As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
(The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

babgbag
^^ ^
babgbag
^^    ^
babgbag
^    ^^
babgbag
  ^  ^^
babgbag
    ^^^
```

        dp = [[None for _ in range(len(s)+1)] for _ in range(len(t)+1)]

        def dfs(i, j):
            if dp[i][j] is not None:
                return dp[i][j]
            if i <= 0:
                return 1
            if j <= 0:

            dp[i][j] = 0
            if t[i-1] == s[j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = dfs(i - 1, j - 1)
            dp[i][j] += dfs(i, j-1)
            return dp[i][j]
        return dfs(len(t), len(s))
